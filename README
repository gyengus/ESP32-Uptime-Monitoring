This is basic uptime monitor written for the ESP32. It was written for an XDA article.

It serves as a framework to monitor services where support can be hardcoded as a type, making it expandable. Users can also add their own GET requests and ping requests, so that it can support any service. You can't set any authorization, which is a limitation of this application, though could be added in the form processing.
